  <p>Five years in the making and still under construction, Talem is a fully-fledged city. Equivalent in size to roughly 10 New York City sized blocks, or 1223 Minecraft blocks/meters^2. It has everything from housing and restaurants to government buildings, schools and even a metro system that is functional with Minecraft mechanics. Some buildings are designed by me while others are modeled after existing and demolished buildings. All buildings are planned to have interiors.</p>
